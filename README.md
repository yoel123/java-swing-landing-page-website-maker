java GUI landing page maker.

I always wanted to create a tool that lets people create websites easily

a form you fill click a button and make a website.

as I'm both fluent in HTML CSS and java swing I decided to test how hard can 
it be to make something like that.

it's nice but during development, I found better ways to do this.

for the meantime, this is the current result, two desktop windows forms
for two landing page designs.

for the HTML CSS I used the matrializecss framework.
I created a classic landing page design and a more complex one.

I also used jade and sass to make the front end development process faster.

for the swing GUI form, I used an absolute layout to make it easier and faster
to position components visually.

included all the code and everything.
