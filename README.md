java gui landing page maker.

I alwayse wanted to create a tool that lets people create websites easiely

a form you fill click a button and make a website.

as im both fluent in html css and java swing I decided to test how hard can 
it be to make somthing like that.

its nice but durring devlopment I found better ways to do this.

for the meantime this is the current result, two descktop windows forms
for two landing page designs.

for the html css I used the matrializecss framework.
I created a clasic landing page design and a more complex one.

I also used jade and sass to make the front end devlopment process faster.

for the swing gui form I used an absoulute layout to make it easier and faster
to position components visually.

included all the code and everything.
